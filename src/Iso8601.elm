{-| Convert from an ISO-8601 date string to a Posix time.

ISO-8601 date strings sometimes specify things in UTC. Other times, they specify
a non-UTC time as well as a UTC offset. I view the choice to support UTC offsets
as a design flaw in ISO-8601 strings. This function corrects this flaw by
normalizing dates into UTC regardless of how they were specified.

For example, if an ISO-8601 date string specifies "9am in UTC+2", this function
will return 7am UTC. The UTC offset is automatically factored in, then discarded.

{-| From <https://www.timeanddate.com/date/leapyear.html>

In the Gregorian calendar three criteria must be taken into account to identify leap years:

  - The year can be evenly divided by 4;
  - If the year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless;
  - The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.

This means that in the Gregorian calendar, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap years.

{-| Inflate a Posix integer into a more memory-intensive ISO-8601 date string.

It's generally best to avoid doing this unless an external API requires it.

(UTC integers are less error-prone, take up less memory, and are more efficient
for time arithmetic.)
